\begin{fw_itemize} 
\item{} \textbf{Well-{}Defined Semantics}: clearly and unambiguously defined behaviour.
\item{} \textbf{Minimal Memory Requirements}: core module footprint of a few kBytes.
\item{} \textbf{Small CPU Demands}: one single level of indirection (due to actions and guards being implemented as function pointers).
\item{} \textbf{Scalability}: memory footprint and CPU demands are independent of number and size of state machine, procedure, and RT Container instances.
\item{} \textbf{High Reliability}: test suite with 100\% code, branch, and condition coverage (excluding error branches for system calls).
\item{} \textbf{Formal Specification}: user requirements formally specify the implementation.
\item{} \textbf{Requirement Traceability}: all requirements are individually traced to their implementation and to verification evidence.
\item{} \textbf{Formal Verification}: key requirements are formally verified using the Spin verifier on a Promela model.
\item{} \textbf{Documented Code}: doxygen documentation for all the source code.
\item \textbf{Demo Application}: complete application demonstrating capabilities and mode of use.
\item{} \textbf{Support for Extensibility}: an inheritance-like mechanism is provided through which a \emph{derived state machine} or a \emph{derived procedure} is created from a \emph{base state machine} or \emph{base procedure} by overriding some of its actions or guards.
