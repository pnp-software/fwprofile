/**
* @mainpage Introduction
*
* The C1 Implementation is a C-language implementation of the modelling concepts of 
* the <strong>FW Profile</strong>.
* It offers components to implement <strong>State Machines</strong>, 
* <strong>Procedures</strong> (activity diagrams), and <strong>RT Containers</strong> (encapsulations of threads).
* The FW Profile is a specification-level modelling language defined as a restriction of UML.
* Its definition is publicly available on the <a href="http://www.pnp-software.com/fwprofile">FW Profile Web Site</a>.
* <p></p>
* The main features of the C1 Implementation are:
* - <strong>Well-Defined Semantics</strong>: semantics of state machines and procedure fully and unambiguously
*   defined by FW Profile. 
* - <strong>Minimal Memory Requirements</strong>: core module footprint of a few kBytes.
* - <strong>Small CPU Demands</strong>: one single level of indirection (due to actions and guards
*   being implemented as function pointers).
* - <strong>Excellent Scalability</strong>: code footprint and CPU requirement independent of number and size of state
*   machine, procedure, and RT container instances.
* - <strong>High Reliability</strong>: a test suite provides full code, branch, and condition coverage (with the exceptions
*   error branches for system calls).
* - <strong>Formal Specification</strong>: formal user requirements specify the implementation.
* - <strong>Requirement Traceability</strong>: requirements individually traced to the source code and to the test 
*   suite.
* - <strong>Formal Verification</strong>: key requirements are formally verified using the Spin verifier on a Promela model.
* - <strong>Documented Code</strong>: doxygen documentation for all the source code.
* - <strong>Support for Extensibility</strong>: an inheritance-like mechanism is provided through which
*   a <i>derived state machine</i> is created from a <i>base state machine</i> by overriding some of its actions or
*   guards and a <i>derived procedure</i> is created from a <i>base procedure</i>.
* .
* These characteristics make the C1 Implementation especially well-suited for use in <strong>mission-critical 
* applications</strong>.
* <p></p>
* This implementation of the FW Profile consists of the following items:
* - An implementation for the @subpage SmMain "State Machine Concept" of the FW Profile
* - An implementation for the @subpage PrMain "Procedure Concept" of the FW Profile
* - An implementation for the @subpage RtMain "RT Container Concept" of the FW Profile
* - A @subpage TsMain "Test Suite" to validate the implementation of the State Machine and Procedure concepts
* - A @subpage DaMain "Demo Application" to demonstrate the use of the State Machine and Procedure concepts
* .
* A <strong>Usage Example</strong> for the state machine implementation can be found @subpage SmExample "here",
* for the procedure implementation it can be found @subpage PrExample "here", and for the RT Container implementation
* it can be found @subpage RtExample "here".
