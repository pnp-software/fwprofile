 * Forward declaration for the pointer to a state machine descriptor.

 * definition of the state machine descriptor (see <code>FwSmPrivate.h</code>) is
 * kept hidden from users.

 * Type for a pointer to a state machine action.
 * A state machine action is a function which encapsulates one of the following:
 * the entry action of a state, the exit action of a state, the do-action of a state,
 * a transition action.
 * A state machine action takes the descriptor of the state machine as an argument.
 *
 * Pointers to state machine actions are used when a new state machine is defined:
 * all the actions in the state machine must be defined as functions which conform
 * to the <code>FwSmAction_t</code> prototype and are loaded into the state machine
 * as function pointers.

 * and it returns 0 to signify that the guard is false or a non-zero value
 * (typically 1) to signify that the guard is true.

 * Pointers to state machine guards are used when a new state machine is defined:
 * all the guards in the state machine must be defined as functions which conform
 * to the <code>FwSmGuard_t</code> prototype and are loaded into the state machine
