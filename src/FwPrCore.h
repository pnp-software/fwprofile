/**
 * @file
 * @ingroup prGroup
 * Declaration of the execution interface for a FW Procedure.
 * The execution interface offers the functions to start and stop
 * a procedure and to execute a procedure.
 * The functions declared in this header file, take a procedure descriptor
 * as their first argument.
 * This represents the procedure upon which the functions operate.
 *
 * The functions declared in this header file can only be used after a
 * procedure has been fully configured.
 * This is normally done using the configuration functions declared
 * in <code>FwPrConfig.h</code>.
 * The basic mode of use of the functions declared in this file is as follows:
 * -# The procedure is started with function <code>::FwPrStart</code>.
 * -# The procedure is executed with function
 *    <code>::FwPrExecute</code>.
 * -# The procedure is stopped with function <code>::FwPrStop</code>.
 * .
 *
 * The functions declared in this header file assume that they are passed
 * a valid procedure descriptor representing a correctly configured
 * procedure.
 * Failure to comply with this assumption will result in undefined
 * behaviour.
