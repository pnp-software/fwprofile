/**
 * @file
 * @ingroup smGroup
 * Declaration of the execution interface for a FW State Machine.
 * The execution interface offers the functions to start and stop
 * a state machine and to command a transition to a state machine.
 * The functions declared in this header file, take a state machine descriptor
 * as their first argument.
 * This represents the state machine upon which the functions operate.
 *
 * The functions declared in this header file can only be used after a
 * state machine has been fully configured.
 * This is normally done using the configuration functions declared
 * in <code>FwSmConfig.h</code>.
 * The basic mode of use of the functions declared in this file is as follows:
 * -# The state machine is started with function <code>::FwSmStart</code>.
 * -# Transitions in the state machine are commanded with functions
 *    <code>::FwSmExecute</code> or <code>::FwSmMakeTrans</code>.
 * -# The state machine is stopped with function <code>::FwSmStop</code>.
 * .
 *
 * The functions declared in this header file assume that they are passed
 * a valid state machine descriptor representing a correctly configured
 * state machine.
 * Failure to comply with this assumption will result in undefined
 * behaviour.

 * Trigger a transition in a state machine. The semantics of this function is defined

 * The logic to execute a transition is implemented by the following activity
 * diagram (this is taken from figure 4.3-3 in the "FW Profile
 * Definition Document"):
 * @image html SM_TransitionExecution.png
 * This operation is recursive because a transition request is propagated to the
 * embedded state machine of the source state. The maximum depth of recursion is the
 * maximum depth of nesting of embedded state machines.
 *
 * If there are two transitions out of the current state which are both activated by
 * this operation, the transition that will actually be taken is the one which was
 * added first to the state machine (i.e. transitions are evaluated in the order in
 * which they were added to the state machine).
 *
 * Similarly, if the transition goes through a choice pseudo-state (CPS) and if
 * there are two transitions out of the CPS which have guards which evaluate to true,
 * the transition to be taken is the one which was added first to the state machine.
 *
 * The FW Profile stipulates that at least one of the transitions out of a CPS
 * must have a guard evaluating to true. This constraint is not enforced by the
 * State Machine Module. If the constraint is violated, the error code is set to
 * #smTransErr.
 *
 * This operation sets the error code to #smTransErr if either of the following non-nominal
 * situations occurs:
 * - the transition encounters a choice pseudo-state which has no out-going transitions
 *   with a true guard; or
 * - the transition encounters a transition which has a choice pseudo-state as both source
 *   and destination of the same transition.
 * .
 * In both the above cases, the state machine may remain in an inconsistent state.
 * @param smDesc the descriptor of the state machine where the transition is triggered.
 * @param transId the identifier of the transition trigger.
