 * Declaration of the dynamical creation interface for a FW State Machine.
 * A FW State Machine is described by a state machine descriptor.
 * This interface declares the functions required to create and release
 * a state machine descriptor dynamically.
 * Dynamic creation and release of memory is done through calls to
 * <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>.
 *
 * A state machine can be created in two ways:
 * - It can be created from scratch, or
 * - It can be created by extending an existing state machine.
 * .
 * The functions offered by this interface cover both creation of a new
 * state machine descriptor from scratch (<code>::FwSmCreate</code>) and
 * the extension of an existing state machine descriptor to create the
 * descriptor for a derived state machine (<code>::FwSmCreateDer</code>).
 *
 * Both the creation and the extension functions create a new state machine
 * descriptor and return a pointer to the newly created descriptor instance.
 * The state machine descriptor returned by these functions is initialized
 * (i.e. all its attributes have a well-defined value) but will normally
 * need to be configured.
 * Configuration can be done using the functions offered by the
 * <code>FwSmConfig.h</code> file.
 *
 * The creation and the extension functions in this header file always check the
 * success of calls to <code>malloc</code>.
 * In case of failure, the caller aborts and returns a NULL pointer.
 *
 * Applications which do not wish to use dynamic memory allocation can
 * create a state machine descriptor statically using the services offered
 * by <code>FwSmSCreate.h</code>.

/**
 * Create a new state machine descriptor.
 * This function creates the state machine descriptor and its internal data structures
 * dynamically through calls to <code>malloc</code>.
 * If any of these calls fails, the function aborts and returns NULL.
 * In this case, there may be a memory leak if part of the state machine descriptor memory
 * had been allocated before the function was aborted.
 *
 * It is legal to create a state machine descriptor with no states or with no choice
 * pseudo-states but it is not legal to create a state machine descriptor with no
 * transitions.
 * If the latter is attempted, the function is aborted and returns NULL.
 * @param nOfStates the number of states in the new state machine (a non-negative number).
 * @param nOfChoicePseudoStates the number of choice pseudo-states in the new state machine
 * (a non-negative integer).
 * @param nOfTrans the number of transitions in the new state machine (a
 * positive integer).
 * @param nOfActions the total number of actions (state actions + transition actions) which the
 * user wishes to define for the state machine.
 * The total number of actions must be a non-negative integer.
 * If the same action appears more than once in a state machine, it is counted only once.
 * @param nOfGuards the total number of transition guards which the
 * user wishes to define for the state machine.
 * The total number of guards must be a non-negative integer.
 * If the same guard appears more than once in a state machine, it is counted only once.
 * @return the descriptor of the new state machine (or NULL if creation of the
 * data structures to hold the state machine descriptor failed or one of the
 * function parameters had an illegal value).

/**
 * Create the descriptor of a derived state machine.
 * A derived state machine is a state machine which is created by extending
 * another state machine.
 * The state machine which is thus extended is called base state machine.
 *
 * This function takes a state machine as an argument and creates a derived
 * state machine from it.
 * The function returns the descriptor of the newly created derived state machine.
 *
 * The base state machine should be fully and correctly configured (i.e. it should
 * pass the configuration check implemented by <code>::FwSmCheck</code>).
 * Compliance with this constraint is not checked by this function.
 * If the constraint is not satisfied, the behaviour of the derived state machine
 * is undefined.
 *
 * After being created, the derived state machine has the following characteristics:
 * - It has the same number of states, choice pseudo-states and transitions as
 *   the base state machine.
 * - Its states and choice pseudo-states are connected by the same transitions as
 *   the base state machine.
 * - Its states have the same actions as the homologous states of the base state
 *   machine.
 * - Its transitions have the same actions and guards and are triggered by the same
 *   transition commands as the homologous transitions of the base state machine.
 * - States whose homologous states in the base state machine have an embedded
 *   state machine also have an embedded state machine: the derivation process
 *   is applied recursively to the embedded state machines (i.e. if state S1 in
 *   the base state machine has an embedded state machine SM1, then the homologous
 *   state in the derived state machine has an embedded state machine which is
 *   derived by extending SM1).
 * .
 * Thus, the derived state machine is a structural clone of its base state machine.
 *
 * The attributes of the derived state machine are initialized as
 * follows:
 * - The error code is the same as the error code of the base state machine.
 * - No state machine data are associated to the derived state machine.
 * - The state machine state is STOPPED.
 * - The execution counters are equal to zero.
 * - The <code>transCnt</code> field in the state machine descriptor is initialized
 *   to zero.
 * .
 * After being created, the derived state machine is fully configured because it
 * inherits the configuration of its base state machine.
 * The configuration of a derived state machine can be modified by:
 * - loading its state machine data;
 * - overriding some or all of its actions and guards; and
 * - embedding state machines in some or all of its states which do not
 *   already hold embedded state machines.
 * .
 * The functions to perform these reconfiguration operations are defined in
 * <code>FwSmConfig.h</code>.
 *
 * A state machine descriptor consists of two parts: the base descriptor and
 * the extension descriptor (see <code>FwSmPrivate.h</code>).
 * A derived state machine and its base state machine share the same base descriptor
 * (which defines the topology of the state machine) but have different extension
 * descriptors.
 * The extension descriptor is linked to the base descriptor through a pointer.
 * This function accordingly creates a new extension descriptor and links it to the
 * base descriptor of the base state machine.
 * @param smDesc the descriptor of the base state machine. The base state machine
 * should be a fully and correctly configured state machine (i.e. it should pass
 * the <code>::FwSmCheck</code> configuration check).
 * @return the descriptor of the derived state machine (or NULL if creation of the
 * data structures to hold the extended state machine descriptor failed).
